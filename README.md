# Social Pragmatics

## Research Question: How do people communicate their intentions by assigning meaning to objects in the world?

- Read Baker et al. 2009 for background
- We want to show that in order to do this assignment, we need:
	1. Theory of Mind (ToM)
	2. Intuitive physics (for understanding costs) 
	3. A sense of cooperation (or lack of)

## To-Do:

- Perform a clean-up/reorganization
- Finish analyzing current results
- Participants should not be able to continue the HIT until they have completely passed the questionnaire
- Start working on presentation; develop a "one-slider," too
