# Social Pragmatics

## Research Question: How do people communicate their intentions by assigning meaning to objects in the world?

- Read Baker et al. 2009 for background
- We want to show that in order to do this assignment, we need:
	1. Theory of Mind (ToM)
	2. Intuitive physics (for understanding costs) 
	3. A sense of cooperation (or lack of)
- Grice (1957)

`populate_cache.sh`: run this with `bash populate_cache.sh` in a bash terminal to populate the `cache` folder with data from the various agent models.

## To-do

- Re-generate `data/observer/model`
- Implement `cache_enforcer_ToM`
- Figure out what's wrong with the "flat" method
- Check "plot_2_a" to check why the lines decrease at reverse points (higher actor preferences communicate sooner)
- Set up a GUI with sliders for each of the parameters; displays how the model predictions change.
