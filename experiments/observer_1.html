If you have questions about this research, please contact Michael Lopez-Brau at <a href="mailto://michael.lopez-brau@yale.edu">michael.lopez-brau@yale.edu</a> or Julian Jara-Ettinger, at julian.jara-ettinger@yale.edu. You must be  at least 18 years old to participate. Your participation in this research is voluntary. You may decline to answer any or all of the following questions. You may decline further participation, at any time, without adverse consequences. Your anonymity is assured; the researchers who have requested your participation will not receive any personal information about you.</p> -->

        <div id="legal"><span style="text-align:center;">Informed Consent Form</span> 

        <p align="left">Purpose: We are conducting research on reasoning. Procedures: This experiment takes around 5-10 minutes to complete.  You will first view a story. Then, in each trial you will view images and answer some multiple-choice questions. You will receive $0.50 upon completing the experiment. Risks and Benefits: Completing this task poses no more risk of harm to you than do the experiences of everyday life (e.g., from working on a computer). Although this study will not benefit you personally, it will contribute to the advancement of our understanding of human reasoning. Confidentiality: All of the responses you provide during this study will be anonymous. You will not be asked to provide any identifying information, such as your name, in any of the questionnaires. Typically, only the researchers involved in this study and those responsible for research oversight will have access to the information you provide. However, we may also share the data with other researchers so that they can check the accuracy of our conclusions; this will not impact you because the data are anonymous. The researcher will not know your name, and no identifying information will be connected to your survey answers in any way. The survey is therefore anonymous. However, your account is associated with an mTurk number that the researcher has to be able to see in order to pay you, and in some cases these numbers are associated with public profiles which could, in theory, be searched. For this reason, though the researcher will not be looking at anyone’s public profiles, the fact of your participation in the research (as opposed to your actual survey responses) is technically considered “confidential” rather than truly anonymous. Voluntary Participation: Your participation in this study is voluntary. You are free to decline to participate, to end your participation at any time for any reason, or to refuse to answer any individual question. Questions: If you have any questions about this study, you may contact Julian Jara-Ettinger at julian.jara-ettinger@yale.edu. If you would like to talk with someone other than the researchers to discuss problems or concerns, to discuss situations in the event that a member of the research team is not available, or to discuss your rights as a research participant, you may contact, and mention HSC number 2000020357:</p>

The hikers always see the boulders because they have to walk around them to get to the groves, but not all hikers realize that <span class="display_enforcer"></span> placed them.

        <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px"><span class="display_enforcer"></span> doesn't have any signs, so <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> instead places boulders that hikers need to walk around.

        <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Hikers always see the boulders, but they don't always realize that <span class="display_enforcer"></span> placed them. When they do not realize that <span class="display_enforcer"></span> placed the boulders, they decide what to do based on how exhausting it would be to get to each grove.

You will be asked how much <span class="display_enforcer"></span> thinks <span class="display_agent"></span> wants <span class="display_preferred_fruit"></span>. You will also be asked how good <span class="display_enforcer"></span> thinks <span class="display_agent"></span> is at knowing that the boulders were placed by <span class="display_enforcer"></span> instead of being there naturally.</p> -->

        <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">On each trial, you will see a hiker at the farm's entrance, the hiker's distance to each grove, and how <span class="display_enforcer"></span> (the farmer) arranged the boulders. Below, to the left, are what hikers, fruit groves, and boulders look like. Below, to the right, is the farm that hikers walk through.</p>

        <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Your task is to figure out what <span class="display_enforcer"></span> was thinking when <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> arranged the boulders. Specifically, you will decide if <span class="display_enforcer"></span> thought that the hiker would realize that <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> placed the boulders, and if <span class="display_enforcer"></span> thought that the hiker preferred <span class="display_preferred_fruit"></span>. As a reminder, <span class="display_enforcer"></span> wants hikers to take apples and not pears.

        <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Remember, hikers are tired when they arrive and <span class="display_enforcer"></span> knows this. The hikers prefer to walk the least amount possible. All hikers can move horizontally or vertically on the grid, but not diagonally. Hikers also cannot walk across squares that have boulders.</p>
