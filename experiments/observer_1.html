                <p>Informed Consent Form</p>
                <p align="left">Purpose: We are conducting research on reasoning.</p>
                <p align="left">Procedures: This experiment takes around 5-10 minutes to complete. You will first view a story. Then, in each trial you will view images and answer some multiple-choice questions. You will receive <span class="display_payment"></span> upon completing the experiment.</p>
                <p align="left">Risks and Benefits: Completing this task poses no more risk of harm to you than do the experiences of everyday life (e.g., from working on a computer). Although this study will not benefit you personally, it will contribute to the advancement of our understanding of human reasoning.</p>
                <p align="left">Confidentiality: All of the responses you provide during this study will be anonymous. You will not be asked to provide any identifying information, such as your name, in any of the questionnaires. Typically, only the researchers involved in this study and those responsible for research oversight will have access to the information you provide. However, we may also share the data with other researchers so that they can check the accuracy of our conclusions; this will not impact you because the data are anonymous. The researcher will not know your name, and no identifying information will be connected to your survey answers in any way. The survey is therefore anonymous. However, your account is associated with an mTurk number that the researcher has to be able to see in order to pay you, and in some cases these numbers are associated with public profiles which could, in theory, be searched. For this reason, though the researcher will not be looking at anyone's public profiles, the fact of your participation in the research (as opposed to your actual survey responses) is technically considered "confidential" rather than truly anonymous.</p>
                <p align="left">Voluntary Participation: Your participation in this study is voluntary. You are free to decline to participate, to end your participation at any time for any reason, or to refuse to answer any individual question. Questions: If you have any questions about this study, you may contact Michael Lopez-Brau at <a style="text-decoration:none" href="mailto:michael.lopez-brau@yale.edu">michael.lopez-brau@yale.edu</a> or Julian Jara-Ettinger at julian.jara-ettinger@yale.edu. If you would like to talk with someone other than the researchers to discuss problems or concerns, to discuss situations in the event that a member of the research team is not available, or to discuss your rights as a research participant, you may contact, and mention HSC number 2000020357:</p>

        <img style="height:200px;width:auto" src="../imgs/forest_1.jpg"></img>
        <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px"><span class="display_enforcer"></span> is a farmer on the mountainous countryside of a small town and has apple and pear crops. Town hikers set up a hiking trail that goes through <span class="display_enforcer_possessive_pronoun"></span> crops and hikers occasionally take fruit when they walk by. <span class="display_enforcer"></span> doesn't mind that hikers take some fruit, but <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> prefers that hikers take <span class="display_preferred_fruit"></span> because <span class="display_not_preferred_fruit"></span> are out of season.</p>

        <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px"><span class="display_enforcer"></span> has learned which hikers walk past each month and which fruits they prefer. For each hiker, <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> takes different actions to make sure that the hiker takes <span class="display_preferred_fruit"></span> instead of <span class="display_not_preferred_fruit"></span>. Since <span class="display_enforcer"></span> doesn't have any signs, <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> instead places 0, 1, 2, or 3 boulders around the <span class="display_not_preferred_fruit_singular"></span> grove that hikers need to walk around. <span class="display_enforcer"></span> knows that some hikers are more or less likely to realize that <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> placed the boulders, but <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> also finds it very exhausting to arrange the boulders, so <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> doesn't always use the most boulders <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> can.</p>

        <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Your task is to figure out what <span class="display_enforcer"></span> was thinking when <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> arranged the boulders. Specifically, you will decide (1) how much <span class="display_enforcer"></span> thought the hiker preferred <span class="display_preferred_fruit"></span> and (2) how good <span class="display_enforcer"></span> expected the hiker to be at detecting that <span class="display_enforcer_pronoun"></span> placed the boulders.</p>
        <p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">All hikers can move horizontally or vertically on the grid, but not diagonally. Hikers also cannot walk across squares that have boulders.</p>
